# Base12
__A simple framework built around the number 12__

_Base12_ is a CSS + SCSS layer for the H5BP to provide the basic elements but leave the playground open wide. It is currently using the CSS in it so feel free to replace the entire `css` folder.

An important aspect of Base12 is that by default it's measurements are all based on the number 12. Since 12 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, it makes it very easy to get a wide variety of sub-measurements while keeping some rhythm in your design.

## Customizing Base12
The boilerplate allows you to do some basic and, I must admit, not so polished customizations. 
This is done through the `main.scss` file. In here you will find variables for common styles such as type color, background, border, font sizes for headings and paragraphs, etc.

```scss
/*  Define your Style
==================================================================================== */

    // Fonts
    $font-heading: 'atrament-web', serif;
    $font-body-copy: 'jubilat', 'Impact', sans-serif;


    // Basic colors
    $color-bg:              #FBFBFB;
    $color-font-heading:    #303030;
    $color-font-body:       #202020;
    $color-selection:       #B3D4FC;


    // Links colors
    $color-links:           #1B4781;
    $color-links-h:         #C04620;
    $color-links-a:         #000000;
    $color-links-v:         $color-links;


    // Borders 
    $border:                1px solid #DADADA;
    $border-focus:          1px solid #C04620;


    // Table colors
    $table-bg:              transparent;
    $table-border:          none;

    $th-bg:                 transparent;
    $th-color:              $color-font-body;
    $th-border:             $border;

    $tr-odd:                transparent;
    $tr-even:               transparent;
    $tr-border:             $border;


    // Button colors
    $btn-primary:           #1B4781;
    $btn-primary-text:      #FBFBFB;

    $btn-hover:             #202020;
    $btn-hover-text:        #FBFBFB;

    $btn-active:            #C04620;
    $btn-active-text:       #FFFFFF;

    $btn-disabled:          #DADADA;
    $btn-disabled-text:     #EBEBEB;


    // Forms
    $field-bg:              #FBFBFB;
    $field-bg-focus:        #FFFFFF;

    $field-color:           #444444;
    $field-color-focus:     #202020;


    // Fonts
    $base-font-size:        12px;   // Preferably in pxs
    $base-line-height:      1.62em; // Preferably in ems


    // Headings - Define in pxs
    $fs-h1: 60px; 
    $lh-h1: 63px; 

    $fs-h2: 36px; 
    $lh-h2: 42px; 

    $fs-h3: 27px; 
    $lh-h3: 33px; 

    $fs-h4: 21px; 
    $lh-h4: 27px; 

    $fs-h5: 15px; 
    $lh-h5: 21px; 

    $fs-h6: 12px; 
    $lh-h6: 18px; 

    // p, ul, ol, etc  - Define in pxs
    $fs-body: 15px;
    $lh-body: 21px;

    // .lead, blockquote - Define in pxs
    $fs-body-accent: 18px;
    $lh-body-accent: 24px;

    // Default font weight when bold
    $font-weight-bold: 600;
```

## Goodies

### Formulas
The boilerplate includes a few formulas (mixins) to help here and there. I plan to add more depending on which ones get used the most.

#### rem()
Developed by [GrowDigital](https://gist.github.com/growdigital/1778907). This formula returns 2 lines of code â€” regular pixel values and converted rem values.

```scss
// Mixin Syntax
@mixin rem($property, $value-in-px)

// Sample input:
.element { @include rem('padding',10px 0 2px 5px); }

// Sample output:
.element {
  padding: 10px 0 2px 5px;
  padding: 1rem 0 0.2rem 0.5rem; }
```

#### em()
An adaptation of [GrowDigital](https://gist.github.com/growdigital/1778907)'s mixin. This formula returns 1 line of code and is mainly used when setting `line-heights`.

```scss
// Mixin Syntax
@mixin em($property, $context-in-px, $value-in-px)

// Sample input:
.element { @include em('line-height', 24px); }

// Sample output:
.element { line-height: 1.5em; }
```

#### transition()
A VERY basic CSS3 transition mixin. Enter your values as desired and it will output the code with prefixes. 

```scss
// Mixin Syntax
@mixin transition($property: all, $duration: .5s, $timing: ease, $delay: null)

// Sample input:
.element { @include transition(all, 1s, ease); }

// Sample output:
.element {
    -webkit-transition: all 1s ease; 
       -moz-transition: all 1s ease; 
        -ms-transition: all 1s ease; 
         -o-transition: all 1s ease; 
            transition: all 1s ease; }
```

## Notes
_This project started as a full boilerplate which included a grid and module system. While I have not discarded this idea, it is not my current focus. I may add these features to Base12 as I work more on it, however I found myself customizing things too much for each project to the point that a single grid system wasn't the right approach to go, it creates limitations, limitations lead to work arounds, and these will in turn create bad code_.
